# Mycropython_ESP01
The only dam micropython version I could find that when flashed wouldn't go crazy with the serial port when trying to connect
Look no more, stop going over hundreds of tutorials with broken links and weird tools.
Flash this shit with esptools or directrly on Thonny using tools>options>interpreter> Fill out the PORT > "Open the dialog for installing or upgrading Myropython firmware on your device" > Select the .bin file that can be found here https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/ > install

Im not going thru this again, save yourself the pain
If you need reasons why every other thing you try doesnt work...
It has to do with the memory of the ESP01 and something about random people messing with some versions of .bin files
